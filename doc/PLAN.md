### Breakout Variation Ideas

### Interesting Existing Game Variations

 * Game 1: Fairy Treasure - This game used gems as a "positive" object and fire as a "negative" object.
 Similarly, we can have "good objects" in our game that drops down from a broken block to increase the
 paddle's score if the paddle collects it. We can also have a "bad object" drop down from a broken block to kill
 the paddle once.

 * Game 2: Super Breakout - This game had different color blocks have different corresponding levels of
 number of hits needed to break the block. Similarly, we can have blocks of varying hardness in our game
 that require a different number of hits to be broken.
